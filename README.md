# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting started

To be able to run this project you will need to add your key to the .env file

# Currency API

When developing this I found that the currency API has been updated and
the [convertCurrency](http://api.currencylayer.com/convert) endpoint is now behind a paywall
so I am mocking this request.

# Troubleshooting

You might have jsx error when opening this depending on the current typescript version installed locally.

If this happens you will need to set your editor to use the workspace version of typescript.

In VSCode you can do this by:
    - click on typescript version number in bottom right
    - select typescript version
    - use workspace version of typescript

### `npm start`
